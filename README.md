Global Shark Attack File's [incident log](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) is unfortunately only available as an XLS spreadsheet. Sharks expects this data to be available as a CSV, so you should install a conversion tool like [xls2csv](http://search.cpan.org/~ken/xls2csv-1.06/script/xls2csv). This can be done via CPAN, or with Yaourt on Archlinux:

```
yaourt -S perl-xls2csv
```
